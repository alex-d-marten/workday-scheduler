# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

# Description
This repository contains JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to assemble a working workday scheduler. The workday scheduler displays the current day and date at the top of the page. There are a series of time blocks for a standard 8AM-5PM workday and each time block is highlighted based on if the time is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green). When you click on a time block, you can enter some text and then save the text to local storage. Upon refreshing the page the newly entered text remains on the page.
